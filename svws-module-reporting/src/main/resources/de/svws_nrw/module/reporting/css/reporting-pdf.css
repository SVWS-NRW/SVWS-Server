-fs-table-paginate: paginate
This property will paginate a table by repeating the thead and tfoot elements on every page where the table rows appear.
There is a paginated table sample at the sandbox. Sadly, there are some known bugs with this property, especially with nested tables.
It is best used with the -fs-page-break-min-height property to avoid the thead sitting on a page by itself.

-fs-page-break-min-height: 1.5cm
This property, which takes a length, will attempt to stop a block or block-like box sitting at the bottom of a page by itself.
For example, if it is set to 2cm for a table and only 1cm of the table would fit on the page, a page break is inserted before the table to satisfy the constraint.
This property is similar to the orphans property but takes a length rather than a number of lines and is applicable to a wider range of boxes such as tables.

-fs-border-rendering: no-bevel
This property, which is set to auto by default, can be used to turn off bevels on borders for a box and its descendants (it inherits).
Unfortunately, bevels on a box, such as a table cell can cause viewers to anti-alias border lines.
This leads to ugly effects such as some borders, despite being the same width, looking thicker or thinner than others. See #752 for a screenshot.
This property was implemented in PR#761 and will be released in version 1.0.10. The property is only honored for solid borders with zero border-radius.
Example:
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  -fs-border-rendering: no-bevel;
}

-fs-max-justification-inter-char and -fs-max-justification-inter-word
These properties control the maximum extra space that the justification algorithm can use when text-align: justify is in effect.
The initial value for inter character space is 0.5 millimetres and inter word spacing is 2 centimetres.
These properties can only be used on block and block-like (such as table cells) elements. These properties inherit by default.
Note: These properties are instead of the text-justify property which only allows a on/off for inter-word/inter-char spacing rather than a configurable length.
